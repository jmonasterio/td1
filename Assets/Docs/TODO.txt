HAVE TO OVERCOME MY DISGUST WITH UNITY.
   PLAN: All levels will be loaded from data file instead of storing level setup in unity.
   


==== Engine Issues
	x Need new JsonFile to replace CsvFile, which is somtimes too limied.
    - Load reset of level from data file.
	- Should PopulateLevel be loading prefabs from the ATLAS?
    - Path editor finds path on each frame. Lame.
	- Need a way to display text.
	- BUILD/RUN doesn't run.
    - GameManager shouldn't have towers, the level should
	- ActiveLevelObject is clunky/slow
    - Layers versus children -- clunky.
	- Levels are clunky.
		- Hard to switch at design time.
		- Waves aren't part of level.
	- Graphics are already really slow.
		- switch to 3d rendering.
	- Datafile -> entity mapping.
	
	- Weird giant graphic flickers on gameover.
-         I think I could make an Animation editor. It would have an animator with an animator controller, that just had one state.
            You could set the clip in it.
 - I shouldn't really be using sprites for HUMANS, ENEMIES, ROBOT, TOWERS, CARCAS
	 - All should be animations (even if just one frame).
	 - This will let me have a much sexier game.
	 - Animations should come from AtlasController and be loaded from disk (maybe from an asset bundle?)
	 - State changes will be handled all in code. Not state machine driven.
	 - Maybe my code should do the animating of various sprites.
 - There should only be one HUMAN prefab (now I have Gatherer + normal).
    - Sprites should be loaded at startup 
	- Size should be data driven.
	- Maybe all the sprites should be on a Sprite controller.
	- Chrome.

	- Level editor scene can write a level to .CSV
	- How should waves.csv handle levels.
	- Preload scene: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35890932/unity-game-manager-script-works-only-one-time

	- EntityClass should be a derived value? on Entity out of sync with Tower Componenet. EntityClass not tower, for example. Could happen to others.

	- When switching levels in editor (at runtime), we should move the level to the camera
		and into the chrome. We don't move the camera at design time.
	- Instead of using RAYCAST, look in the grid.
	- xlsx entity integration
	- Have a way for wave to start off screen.
	- Need to prevent block a cell that already has an enemy in it.
	- Need to keep track of which cells have enemies.
	- Need to look, when I am about to enter a new cell, to see whether the path follower is blocked, and needs to turn back.
	- Pause a level.

==== GamePlay Issues


- Design the flow of the main screens.

- Why is the robot not in the tree? Why is a robot a friend of the enemies?

- MANUAL WORKAROUND: City needs to be a special kind of tower. Right now, they're not related.
- Different kinds of money
	- Money to spawn humans.
	- Money to create towers
	- Money to heal

- Maybe my entities should have no methods, and all work should be done in controllers. Like that paper I read.

 - What to do when human dropped on shooter towere and city tower.
 - What to do when carcas dropped on shooter towere and city tower.

x If gatherer in cell with carcas, should pick up some. 
    - Alien bodies, when gathered, get taken to the soylent power plant or robot. And that gives you a higher spawn rate of humans.
- Drag to tower, should add "grow" to that one tower. Drag to robot put's it in the pot.
- Some kinds of humans should take longer to make.
- Humans should powerup if they hit a city or tower or robot.
	- If human wanders into a city or robot, it should go inside...
- Hurt humans should head to a city/tower.

- Maybe robot should be keep track of All Available 


- CNR: Wanderers are jumpy when they switch targets. Because should only switch targets near center of cell? Or lerp to new path.
- City spawned human should get settings from CSV. Not from PREFAB.

- Carcas should only be worth some part for growing stuff.
- Can gatherers pick up dead humans? Or just dead enemies?
- Level one only has the gatherer tower. Gathers's go get body of dead aliens. Humans get converted into gatherer.

- Different texture for various carcas types.
- Different texture for various human types.

- Enemy seems to stop abruptly, when exploding.
- Planning screen...


- Need decompose graphics for humans and towers.
- Should AnimStates be for entities?
- Draw HUD on a canvas.
- Colision with robot is too far away. 
- What happens when an enemy collides with a tower? Nothing?
- Need men and women.
- Need different kinds of guns? Part of entity?
- Need different types of bullets.
- # of cities on the map affects the spawn rate.
- Build the love shack
- Tower that creates random humans should look like a little hostpiatl

- Wave co-routines: Need to stop if level ends in middle of a wave. I have Wave.CancelWave() method, but not called for now.
- Maybe option to autdrop if you go over city.
- If money goes down while dragging below cost, we may not be able to drop. OR take money at start of drop, and return if not used.
- Mob may stop to fight robot? Maybe stop to fight.
- Animate back to palete
- Human needs to be shorter (and centered?) so they don't try to draw over wall.


- Spawn humans randomly.

- Cities
- Humans
- Move level to correct spot in 

- Start with enough "pwer" to make one towner.
- Untrained humans spawn at cities.
- Grabbing carcuses and humans
- Humans: Gatehrer, builders, attackers, cyborg...


- Wide spawning.
- Wide waves
- 3-levels per map (easy, medium, hard).


- Humans, Resources (cities), Mobs, and Robots should come from spreadsheets


- Snap to grid seems to screw up the dropping of dirt. TURNED OFF FOR NOW.
- Speed to next wavelet.

- Multiselect humans would be a powerup.
