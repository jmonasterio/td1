x BUG: Drop on city seems to destroy it.
x Indicate the cell or item you'll drop on.
x Drag spawner for tower gets dragged.
x Don't show dragRect when on cells that you can't drop on.
x Dragged item should not be opaque.
x Don't allow draggin things that are stationary.
x Dragging tower goes behind palette.
x STILL SHITTY CODE: Edge of map not detect properly.
x After moving a human, he doesn't start pathing anymore.
x Dragging tower should not shoot, or be a target.
x Bong if illegal drop.
x Am I really reloading grid on every frame?
x Drop a block, not blocking enemies.
x Enemies not going back.
x X icon if illegal drop cell.
x Can drop offscreen again.
x Enemies are routing around the bottom.
x When human or enemy moves, they need to be moved to another cell.
x don't allow dropping wall on a human
x Human should pause for a second after being dropped.
x After a drop/cancel, human seems to jump. Because when they start to wander, the wander code assumes the human is at the center of the cell to start. But they are not.
x Offscreen ends up with items??? Why.
x human goes behind wall
x Multiple entry points and multiple routes.
x Not getting X when dragging human.
x Support real waypoints to help designer.
x Fill-in Waves.MidWaypoint from the Path object. Don't specifiy each one point, just specify the "path" gameObject in the Wave.
x Can't drop on city.
x Enemy collision with robot... damages robot. Kills enemy.
x Connect explosion prefabs to prefabs, instead of making a child object.
x Can't seem to drop blocks or towers: GameManagerScript disabled which disabled audiocontroller.
x In editor, draw lines on path.
x Csv should allow comment lines ;;;
x Humans shoot. 
x Humans die.
x Robot not dying?
x Not needed: Enemy reaches end of path, should just start wandering if for some reason there is no robot. Or maybe a new path to robot? Should never happen.
x Robot dies... level over.
x Enemy should not be deleted until they really decompose.
x Enemies all die... next level.
x DEBUG: Loop level to restart waves when you lose
x Enemies shoot.
x Enemies die.
x After being dead a while, the body should decompose.
x Dragging block makes a small block
x Real health
x xlsx wave integration
x Hide reticle while dragging.
x Enemies are walking through walls.
x Shooting enemies.

x Dropped carcas does not resume decomposing (if cancel drop) with correct amount of remaining time.
x Dropping carcases on city/robot not working.
x Don't allow dropping human on decomposing city.
x Do allow dropping new city on decomposing city.


x Maybe a "Decomposer" ought to be a kind of entity, that keeps track of related entity that was decomposed.
	- Benefit would be, we don't need special logic like: Don't allow dropping on while decomposing.
	- You could build another city on a decomposing one, and it wouldn't use up the "slot".
- MANUAL WORKAROUND: City needs to be a special kind of tower. Right now, they're not related.

x Carcas not decomposing.
x Carcas not animating.
x Carcas income value not set when created.
- Weird giant graphic flickers on gameover.

x Entity should either store the current cell, or be really good at getting it back.

- Different kinds of money
	- Money to spawn humans.
	- Money to create towers
	- Money to heal

 -Human:126 - Human gatherer, should try to go to gatherer city.

- If gatherer in cell with carcas, should pick up some. 
    - Alien bodies, when gathered, get taken to the soylent power plant or robot. And that gives you a higher spawn rate of humans.
- Drag to tower, should add "grow" to that one tower. Drag to robot put's it in the pot.
- Some kinds of humans should take longer to make.
- Humans should powerup if they hit a city or tower or robot.
	- If human wanders into a city or robot, it should go inside...
- Hurt humans should head to a city/tower.

- Maybe robot should be keep track of All Available g

x What stops a city from spawning humans? Run out of spawn money.
x Gatherer city makes gatherers.
x Regular city makes standard.

- Humans to spawn at one city and go to other cities.

- RandomTowerCell should exclude the tower where the human was spawned.
- City spawned human should get settings from CSV. Not from PREFAB.

- Carcas should only be worth some part for growing stuff.

- Level one only has the gatherer tower. Gathers's go get body of dead aliens. Humans get converted into gatherer.
x Do we need a build rate
x How to include GrowRate in part of human growth calc

- Level editor scene can write a level to .CSV
- How should waves.csv handle levels.
- Enemy seems to stop abruptly, when exploding.
- Preload scene: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35890932/unity-game-manager-script-works-only-one-time
- Planning screen...


- Need decompose graphics for humans and towers.
- Should AnimStates be for entities?
- Draw HUD on a canvas.
- Colision with robot is too far away. 
- What happens when an enemy collides with a tower? Nothing?
- Need men and women.
x Need a spawn rate indicator.
- Need different kinds of guns? Part of entity?
- Need different types of bullets.
- # of cities on the map affects the spawn rate.
- Build the love shack
- Tower that creates random humans should look like a little hostpiatl

- EntityClass should be a derived value? on Entity out of sync with Tower Componenet. EntityClass not tower, for example. Could happen to others.
- Wave co-routines: Need to stop if level ends in middle of a wave. I have Wave.CancelWave() method, but not called for now.
- Maybe option to autdrop if you go over city.
- If money goes down while dragging below cost, we may not be able to drop. OR take money at start of drop, and return if not used.
x Mob explodes and does damage to the robot. 
- Mob may stop to fight robot? Maybe stop to fight.
- Animate back to palete
- Human needs to be shorter (and centered?) so they don't try to draw over wall.


- Instead of using RAYCAST, look in the grid.
- xlsx entity integration

- Spawn humans randomly.

- Cities
- Humans
- Move level to correct spot in 

- Start with enough "pwer" to make one towner.
- Untrained humans spawn at cities.
- Grabbing carcuses and humans
- Humans: Gatehrer, builders, attackers, cyborg...


- Wide spawning.
- Wide waves
- 3-levels per map (easy, medium, hard).


- Humans, Resources (cities), Mobs, and Robots should come from spreadsheets

x Mob Waves should come from spreadsheets
- When switching levels in editor (at runtime), we should move the level to the camera
	and into the chrome. We don't move the camera at design time.
- It might make sense at runtime to COPY a level, so that we can re-run from original copy.
- Snap to grid seems to screw up the dropping of dirt. TURNED OFF FOR NOW.
- Have a way for wave to start off screen.
- Pause a level.
- Speed to next wavelet.
- Need to look, when I am about to enter a new cell, to see whether the path follower is blocked, and needs to turn back.
- Need to prevent block a cell that already has an enemy in it.
- Need to keep track of which cells have enemies.

- Multiselect humans would be a powerup.


x When dropping towers, why do I get so many?
x Grab humans and drop on resources or tower. Show while dragging. Return if a miss.
x Towers and Cells can't be dropped on, because not on the grid... Hmmmm.

x Don't drop on occupied squares.

x Human Random walk
x Humans "jump" at end of path.
x Maybe do PICK & CLICK instead of DRAG and DROP
x Drop a human anywhere, instead of just on a robot.
x Teleport or walk to city? Darrin wants teleport.
x Speed should be on the ENTITY, not on the PATH FOLLOWER
x Don't drop off map.
x Place towers
x Only place towers if enough income.
x Keep track of income.
x Rename source to "palette" or something.
x Add ability to drop a tower.
x Add ability to drop terrain.

x MVC: https://www.toptal.com/unity-unity3d/unity-with-mvc-how-to-level-up-your-game-development
x Need more delay between bullets
x OnGui needs to draw path for each enemy.
x GameGrid shouldn't have the path. The FOLLOWER should have the path.
x Create an enemy wave.
x Set target of enemy when you create it, instead of in update.
x Keep track of how many enemies make it home. So we know we lost.
x Detect when level is over.
x Create wave from wave collection.
x Kill enemies that are hit by too many bullets
x Start keeping simple score.
x Add health to enemy and towers.
