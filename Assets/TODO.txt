x BUG: Drop on city seems to destroy it.
x Indicate the cell or item you'll drop on.
x Drag spawner for tower gets dragged.
x Don't show dragRect when on cells that you can't drop on.
x Dragged item should not be opaque.
- Don't allow draggin things that are stationary.
x Dragging tower goes behind palette.
- Edge of map not detect properly.
- After moving a human, he doesn't start pathing anymore.
- Dragging tower should not shoot, or be a target.
- Bong if illegal drop.
- X icon if illegal drop cell.
- Animate back to palete
x Dragging block makes a small block
- Offscreen ends up with items??? Why.
- don't allow dropping wall on a human
- human goes behind wall
- Maybe option to autdrop if you go over city.
- If money goes down while dragging below cost, we may not be able to drop.


- Real health
- Hide reticle while dragging.
- Enemies are walking through walls.
- Instead of using RAYCAST, look in the grid.
- xlsx entity integration
- xlsx wave integration

- Spawn humans randomly.

- Cities
- Humans
- Shooting enemies.
- Move level to correct spot in 

- Start with enough "pwer" to make one towner.
- Untrained humans spawn at cities.
- Grabbing carcuses and humans
- Humans: Gatehrer, builders, attackers, cyborg...


- Wide spawning.
- Wide waves
- 3-levels per map (easy, medium, hard).


- Humans, Resources (cities), Mobs, and Robots should come from spreadsheets

- Mob Waves should come from spreadsheets
- When switching levels in editor (at runtime), we should move the level to the camera
	and into the chrome. We don't move the camera at design time.
- It might make sense at runtime to COPY a level, so that we can re-run from original copy.
- Snap to grid seems to screw up the dropping of dirt. TURNED OFF FOR NOW.
- Have a way for wave to start off screen.
- Pause a level.
- Speed to next wavelet.
- Need to look, when I am about to enter a new cell, to see whether the path follower is blocked, and needs to turn back.
- Need to prevent block a cell that already has an enemy in it.
- Need to keep track of which cells have enemies.
- If human wanders into a city or robot, it should go inside...
- Multiselect humans would be a powerup.


x When dropping towers, why do I get so many?
x Grab humans and drop on resources or tower. Show while dragging. Return if a miss.
x Towers and Cells can't be dropped on, because not on the grid... Hmmmm.

x Don't drop on occupied squares.

x Human Random walk
x Humans "jump" at end of path.
x Maybe do PICK & CLICK instead of DRAG and DROP
x Drop a human anywhere, instead of just on a robot.
x Teleport or walk to city? Darrin wants teleport.
x Speed should be on the ENTITY, not on the PATH FOLLOWER
x Don't drop off map.
x Place towers
x Only place towers if enough income.
x Keep track of income.
x Rename source to "palette" or something.
x Add ability to drop a tower.
x Add ability to drop terrain.

x MVC: https://www.toptal.com/unity-unity3d/unity-with-mvc-how-to-level-up-your-game-development
x Need more delay between bullets
x OnGui needs to draw path for each enemy.
x GameGrid shouldn't have the path. The FOLLOWER should have the path.
x Create an enemy wave.
x Set target of enemy when you create it, instead of in update.
x Keep track of how many enemies make it home. So we know we lost.
x Detect when level is over.
x Create wave from wave collection.
x Kill enemies that are hit by too many bullets
x Start keeping simple score.
x Add health to enemy and towers.
