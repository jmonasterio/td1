- Snap to grid seems to screw up the dropping of dirt. TURNED OFF FOR NOW.
- Add ability to drop a tower.
x Add ability to drop terrain.
- Have a way for wave to start off screen.
- Pause a level.
- Speed to next wavelet.
- Need to look, when I am about to enter a new cell, to see whether the path follower is blocked, and needs to turn back.
- Need to prevent block a cell that already has an enemy in it.
- Need to keep track of which cells have enemies.

x MVC: https://www.toptal.com/unity-unity3d/unity-with-mvc-how-to-level-up-your-game-development
x Need more delay between bullets
x OnGui needs to draw path for each enemy.
x GameGrid shouldn't have the path. The FOLLOWER should have the path.
x Create an enemy wave.
x Set target of enemy when you create it, instead of in update.
x Keep track of how many enemies make it home. So we know we lost.
x Detect when level is over.
x Create wave from wave collection.
x Kill enemies that are hit by too many bullets
x Start keeping simple score.
x Add health to enemy and towers.
