x Need more delay between bullets
x OnGui needs to draw path for each enemy.
x GameGrid shouldn't have the path. The FOLLOWER should have the path.
x Create an enemy wave.
- Have a way for wave to start off screen.
- Detect when level is over.
- Pause a level.
- Speed to next wavelet.
x Create wave from wave collection.
- Kill enemies that are hit by too many bullets
- Start keeping simple score.
- Add health to enemy and towers.
- Add ability to drop a tower.

- Need to look, when I am about to enter a new cell, to see whether the path follower is blocked, and needs to turn back.
- Need to prevent block a cell that already has an enemy in it.
- Need to keep track of which cells have enemies.
